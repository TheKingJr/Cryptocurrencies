# Cryptocurrencies Challenge 18

## Overview of Project

The premise of this analysis was to create a report to pitch Martha's firm on what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped into a classification system for a new investment portfolio offering. This report was achieved by learning the key differences between supervised and unsupervised learning and ultimately select the better choice for this analysis. After selecting unsupervised learning, since we're not sure what we're looking for, the cryptocurrency data needed to be preprocessed for the unsupervised learning. After the preprocessing step was completed, the steps that followed were: the standardization of key features, the utilization of PCA, and the elbow curve. These final steps allowed for the K-means algorithm to be utilized for cluster prediction and create visualizations for the Accountability Accounting. Please see below for the analysis deliverables.

- Deliverable 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA

- Deliverable 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA

- Deliverable 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means

- Deliverable 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
